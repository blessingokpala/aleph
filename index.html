              <p class="card-text">Modern Stock Take (MST) is an operation which performs a stocktake in each large format store twice per year. The aim of the operation is to correct any inaccuracies in the stock records of these stores in order to drive an improvement in availability. The stocktakes are performed by two external count companies (RGIS and OCS). The operation has two aims:              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate stocktakes</li>
                <li>Provide stocktakes that have minimal impact on the customer</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Tesco Connect Stocktake is a tool that provides up-to-date performance information relating to the Modern Stock Take operation. It allows any threats to delivering the two operational aims to be identified, which then means timely interventions can be made to protect the operation. By making such interventions the operation will be delivered at a consistent high standard.</p>
